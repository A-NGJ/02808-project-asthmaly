# Asthmaly - your personal asthma tracker
Asthmaly aims to make it simply and intuitive for asthmatics of all ages to track and understand their symptoms, activities and medication use. This lets the users get more in touch with their asthma and helps them understand trends in their data.

The first thing the user sees is the login page, where a login and password can be provided to log into a personal account on firebase.

The next screen the user sees is the home screen. This allows for tracking of symptoms and medication in one simple click. Activities can also be tracked in two clicks, allowing for chosing between different types of activity.

After having tracked symptoms, medication and activities systematically for some time, the user can analyze and understand their data using the visualizations tab. This tab has two different pages of visualizations; Symptoms and activity. The symptoms tab shows the number of symptoms over a month and as a 24-hour format. This shows how the number of symptoms changes over each day and when during the day the user gets most symptoms. The activity visualizations give an overview of how activites affect the symptoms and which activities might be best to take assistive medication for.
